implement better algorithms and methods:
a better (possibly iterative) algorithm for converting cart to geo
jacchia model atmosphere - dependent on time and geographical position
get real rocket data -> database
possibly a better numerical integrator, but not likely

limitations:
this works only in the relative vicinity of the Earth (not taking in the gravitational pull of other solar system bodies)
